## Civil Network Development


**Who are we?** 


Run by me (Quartinal) and with ascendency from [@PrestonT500](https://github.com/PrestonT500) and [@accessgames](https://github.com/accessgames), we are a team of developers that create open-source projects to elude internet suppression.


#### Our notable projects (that we are proud of and will maintain for years to come)


**[Civil](https://github.com/civilnetwork-dev/Civil)** - Easily-reproducible anonymous web proxy fueled by both pure JavaScript (coming soon) and Ultraviolet.

**[Rammerhead443](https://github.com/civilnetwork-dev/rammerhead-443)** - An updated version of Rammerhead, making it usable and sophisticated throughout every proxy
#### Our WIP projects (that we aren't really going to maintain into the near future)


**[That's an Error](https://github.com/civilnetwork-dev/ThatsAnError)** - A spoof of Google's non-beautiful error page

**[chromiumeos](https://github.com/civilnetwork-dev/chromiumeos)** - Chrome/ChromeOS design guidelines
